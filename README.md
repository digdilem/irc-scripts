# irc-scripts
A selection of scripts for irssi, x-chat, eggdrop and some quote files

Many years ago I created a site for people to upload various IRC related scripts. After a couple of decades of hosting it, I've exported the uploaded files here in the hope they will be useful. 

I've removed those not by myself from here. All are public domain / freeware. Do with what thou wilt.
