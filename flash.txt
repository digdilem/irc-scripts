I've got a plan and it's as hot as my pants!
Where haven't I been?
Hey Melchie! Still worshipping God? Last time I heard, he was worshipping me!
I like it firm and fruity.
She's got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a man's tonsils.
WOOF WOOF!
Treat your kite like you treat your woman... Get inside her five times a day and take her to Heaven and back.
Well, well, well, if it isn't captain slackbladder. Couldn't resist, eh? Told you you thought I was great!
Hey! Any girl who wants to chain herself to may railing and suffer a jet movement gets my vote!
That's how I like my girls...straight and to my point.
Mind if I use your phone? If word gets out that I'm missing, 500 girls will kill themselves and I wouldn't like them on my conscience. Not when they ought to be on my face!
Enter the man who wears no underwear, ask me why! (why do wear no underwear lord flash?) Because the pants havn't been built yet that can take the job on!
Bring me Melchett's driver Parkhurst, she's used to hanging around with a big knob, so she'll be used to a fellow like me!
Gosh potatoes George, you said noble brother fliers were in the lurch. If I'd have known it was captain slack bladder and the mound of the hound of the baskervilles, I'd have let them stew in their own juice. And let mw tell you if I ever did that, I'd probably drown!
Just because I can give multiple orgasms to the furniture just by sitting on it.
Hey girls, look at my machinery!
It's me, Flash! Flash by name, Flash by nature. 
Thanks bridesmaid, like the beard. Gives me something to hang on to.
Eat knuckle, Fritz. [He knocks Blackadder to the ground and holds him there with his foot.] How disgusting, a Bosch on the sole of my boot. I shall have to find a patch of grass to wipe it in. I'll be shunned in the Officer's Mess. "Sorry about the pong, you fellas; trod in the Bosch and can't get rid of the WHIFF."
